<h3>Time series</h3>
<p>
    Many executions are made as parts of a time series. 
    There are a number of ways these may be modeled using the SSN Ontology.
</p>
<p>
    The most explicit representation is as an for each member of the series to be an individual member of a <a href="#Collections">Collection</a>.
    For example <a href="#timeseries-oc"></a> shows an <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">Collection of Observations</a> that has a member for each time-step in the series.
</p>
<figure id="timeseries-oc">
    <img alt="Observation feature-of-interest patterns 1" src="./images/timeseries-oc.svg" style="width:90%" />
    <figcaption>
        Collection of observations of the same property on the same feature of interest, with each member representing a step in the time-series.
        <br>
        <em><a href="#class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/timeseries-oc.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<p>
    Alternatively, the series may be represented as a single <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observation</a> with a <a href="#SOSAhasResult">hasResult</a> that is a complex value, such as a vector or array.
    This may be indicated 'inline' as a complex data-structure, or 'linked' to a separate resource, as in the following two examples. 
</p>
<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/timeseries-result-inline.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
<br>
<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/timeseries-result-link.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
