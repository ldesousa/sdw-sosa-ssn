<h3>Location and Geometry</h3>

<h4>Location</h4>
<p>
    Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
    sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be located via their
    participating entities, e.g., platforms.
    These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains,
    including technical disciplines, social and business contexts.
    In these contexts there are a number of implementations that support the expression of spatial properties,
    including location.
    These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]].
</p>
<p>
    In particular, GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
    objects, that fosters interoperability between geo-datasets. To do so, these entities can be declared as
    instances of <code>geo:Feature</code> and geometries can be assigned to them via the <code>geo:hasGeometry</code>
    property.
    In case of classes, e.g., specific features of interests such as rivers, these MAY be defined as subclasses
    of <code>geo:Feature</code>.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it might be described as a
    Sample using the following pattern:
</p>
<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/SampleLocation.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
<p>
    Note that, even though <code>earthAtmosphere_StE</code> is not explicitly typed <code>geo:Feature</code>, the
    property <code>geo:hasGeometry</code> has a global domain constraint which entails that any resource carrying this
    property SHALL be inferred to be a <code>geo:Feature</code>.
    Thus <code>earthAtmosphere_StE</code> is <em>both</em> a <code>sosa:Sample</code> and a <code>geo:Feature</code>.
</p>

<h4>Geometry</h4>
<p>
    Geometry may appear in other contexts than as an explicit property of a <code>geo:Feature</code>.
    For example, a determination of location using a GPS received can be described as an <code>Observation</code> whose
    <code>sosa:hasResult</code> is a geometry value.
    The following example illustrates this pattern, with the result being a GeoSPARQL <code>Geometry</code> object:
</p>
<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/GeometryResult.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
<p>
    The WKT representation of the result could be encoded directly as a 'simple' (literal) result:
</p>
<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/GeometryResultSimple.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
