<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
    sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be located via their
    participating entities, e.g., platforms.
    These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains, including
    technical disciplines, social and business contexts.
    In these contexts there are a number of implementations that support the expression of spatial properties,
    including location.
    These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]]. </p>
<p>In particular, GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
    objects, that fosters interoperability between geo-datasets. To do so, these entities can be declared as
    instances of geo:Feature and geometries can be assigned to them via the geo:hasGeometry property.
    In case of classes, e.g., specific features of interests such as rivers, these can be defined as subclasses of
    geo:Feature.</p>
<p>For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it might be described as a
    Sample using the following pattern:</p>
