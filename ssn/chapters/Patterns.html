    <h3>SSN profiles</h3>
    <p>
        The SSN Ontology provides a set of general terms for describing Actuations, Observations and Samplings.
        However, the supporting classes
        (i.e. <a href="#SOSAProcedure"><code>Procedure</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSAActuatingProcedure"><code>ActuatingProcedure</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSAObservingProcedure"><code>ObservingProcedure</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSASamplingProcedure"><code>SamplingProcedure</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>System</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSAActuator"><code>Actuator</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSASensor"><code>Sensor</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSASampler"><code>Sampler</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSAFeatureOfInterest"><code>FeatureOfInterest</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSASample"><code>Sample</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>Property</code></a>
        , <a href="#SOSAObservableProperty"><code>ObservableProperty</code></a>
        etc) have no properties specified except for the relationships between individuals from the classes.
        Furthermore, there are a large number of these relationship predicates, which can lead to a rather tangled
        dataset in practice.
        Thus, any application that uses SSN must select an <em>implementation pattern</em> to constrain the variability.
        And in order to support interoperability with other applications, the implementation pattern should be
        formalized and shared.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is beyond the scope of this document to provide implementation profiles.
        However, a number of frequent requirements are discussed and illustrated in this section, including quantity
        values with a unit of measure, locations, and forecasts.
    </p>
    <p class="note">OGC is planning to develop a register of SSN implementation profiles to support the development of
        interoparable communities using SSN.</p>

<section id="quantity-values-and-unit-of-measures" class="informative">
    <h3>Unit of Measurement</h3>
    <p>
        The result of an <a href="#SOSAObservation"><code>sosa:Observation</code></a> or
        <a href="#SOSAActuation"><code>sosa:Actuation</code></a> may be a quantity composed of a number and unit of
        measurement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several external vocabularies are designed for modeling quantity values as OWL individuals, or as datatypes.
        Examples include the Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT, [[QUDT]]) the Ontology of
        Units of Measure (OM, [[Rijgersberg-et-al-2013]]), and the St Etienne School of Mines <i>Custom Datatypes</i>
        (CDT, [[CDT]]).
    </p>

    <h4>Simple Result</h4>
    <p>
        For a compact representation using <a href="#SOSAhasSimpleResult">sosa:hasSimpleResult</a> it is recommended to
        use a QUDT Unit as its <i>Datatype</i>.

    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2024ex-uomtype.jsonld" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <p class="note">When the datatype is not one of the numeric types, the value is cast as a string literal.</p>

    <h4>Structured Result</h4>
    <p>
        Alternatively, a <a href="http://qudt.org/"><code>qudt:QuantityValue</code></a> can represent a quantitative
        result structured as an object.

<section id="location">
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>
        Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
        sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, or activities that can be located via their participating
        entities, e.g., platforms.
        These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains, including
        technical disciplines, social and business contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Standards for spatial properties are discussed in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]].
        In particular, GeoSPARQL [[geosparql]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
        objects, to support interoperability between geo-datasets.
        Using GeoSPARQL, geometries can be assigned to entities using the geo:hasGeometry property.
    </p>

    <h4>Sample with location</h4>
    <p>
        For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it is recommended that this be
        defined as a Sample whose location is given using GeoSPARQL with the following pattern:

</section>

<section id="forecasts" class="informative">
    <h3>Forecasts</h3>
    <p>
        A forecast may be represented as an observation where the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
        time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
        This means that: The time when the Observation execution was completed is before the time that the Result of the
        observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.
    </p>
    <h4>Forecast</h4>

    <h5>Serialised in JSON-LD</h5>

    <p class="note">
        Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
        For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
        pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.

<section id="SOSAProperty-instances" class="informative">
    <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of sosa:Property</h3>
    <p>
        The previous edition of SSN [[vocab-ssn-20171019]] left an ambiguity on whether an instance of <a
            href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> should be generic to all features of interest (e.g.,
        <code>ex:Temperature</code>, <code>ex:OnOffStatus</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;myBodyTemperature&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;LightStatus&gt;</code>).
        This version solves the ambiguity by differentiating:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> for the former case, where properties are generic
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="#SOSAPropertyOfInterest"><code>sosa:PropertyOfInterest</code></a> for the latter case, where
            properties are tied to a single entity.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section id="SOSASystem-instances" class="informative">
    <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of sosa:System</h3>
    <p>
        SSN does not specify whether an instance of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>
        should be generic (e.g., <code>ex:TemperatureSensor</code>,
        <code>ex:LightActuator</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;temperatureSensor/84&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;light/112&gt;</code>).
        Implementers are free to choose either way of modeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, one SHOULD NOT use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F12:_Punning">OWL
            punning</a> to make <code>ex:Temperature</code> denote both a subclass of
        <a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> and an instance of sosa:Property.
        In fact, merging the two examples below in a single RDF Graph would make an OWL reasoner infer that
        <code>ex:TemperatureSensor</code>, <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/1&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/2&gt;</code>, denote the same individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        This also holds for subclasses of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>: <a
            href="#SOSASensor"><code>sosa:Sensor</code></a>, <a href="#SOSAActuator"><code>sosa:Actuator</code></a>, and
        <a href="#SOSASampler"><code>sosa:Sampler</code></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This first example is modeling instances of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> as generic:
    </p>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2017ex6.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <p>
        This second example is modeling instances of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> as specific:
    </p>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2017ex7.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<section id="ultimate-feature-of-interest">
    <h3>Ultimate feature of interest</h3>
    <p>
        The object of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">hasFeatureOfInterest</a> property of an act
        of observation, sampling, or actuation is the <i>immediate</i> or <i>proximate</i>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">FeatureOfInterest</a>.
        In some cases this is not the the ultimate thing that the act of observation, sampling, or actuation is
        concerned with, but is an intermediate thing, often a <i>sample</i> of the ultimate feature of interest, or
        perhaps a sample of a sample, etc.
        There will often be a specifiable relationship between the proximate and ultimate feature of interest, such as a
        sampling-chain.
        If this relationship is recorded, then an ultimate feature of interest might be inferred.
        Nevertheless, particularly for discovery purposes, it is usually the ultimate feature of interest that really
        matters to the data user.
        This requirement is satisfied by an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/#Object_Properties">object
            property</a> called <code>hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some patterns for the relationship of the ultimate feature of interest to observations (
        <a href="#fig-observation-ultimate-foi"></a>) and acts of sampling (
        <a href="#fig-sampling-ultimate-foi"></a>), and within sampling-chains, are illustrated below.
    </p>

<section id="sample-chains">
    <h3>Basis of a chain of samples</h3>
    <p>
        Many observation workflows rely on a chain of samples, each making a sub-sample of the predecessor sample.
        Knowing either the original sample or the initial feature of interest at the base of the chain is often useful
        for both discovery and management purposes.
        For example, <a href="#fig-sample-chain-geology"></a> shows a scenario from geology involving many samples
        derived from an initial one, with some relationships that may be useful in processing and discovery of
        subsequent observations, the intention of which will be to characterize various aspects of the original sample
        which is representative of an ultimate feature of interest.
        This is supported by two further <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/#Object_Properties">object
            properties</a> for relationships between samples and features of interest, called
        <code>hasOriginalSample</code> and <code>hasSampledFeature</code>.
    </p>

    <figure id="fig-sample-chain-geology">
        <img alt="Sample chain example from geology" src="./images/SamplingChainGeology.png" style="width:90%" />
        <figcaption>It is common to generate a chain of samples in a geology exploration scenario, with initial sample
            retrieval from the field followed by a sequence of sample preparation steps to generate a series of
            sub-samples.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Having a direct indication of an original sample allows multiple results to be combined to describe the sample.
        Having a direct indication of the ultimate feature being sampled allows discovery of many samples that are
        intended to be representative of that feature.
    </p>

    <p class="Note">Note that the scenario in <a href="#fig-sample-chain-geology"></a> is simplified from real-life
        scenarios, and also that the diagram only shows a subset of the full set of resources and relationships.</p>

<section id="observation-collection">
    <h3>Homogeneous collection of observations</h3>

    <p>
        A collection of observations may share a common value for one or more of the characteristic observation
        properties.
        For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            many monitoring processes generate a stream of data in which only the (phenomenon-) time changes between
            consecutive results for the same property on a single feature of interest, observed using the same procedure
            implemented using the same sensor.
        </li>
        <li>
            a sensor network typically generates a set of results, over the same time interval, for the same
            property(s), over a suite of features-of-interest.
            Imaging sensors could be considered a special case of this, where the proximate features-of-interest
            correspond with individual pixels in the result.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These patterns can be accommodated with the class <code>ObservationCollection</code> individuals of which may
        hold one or more of the essential properties of an atomic observation, except for the result.
        Where present, the value of the property(s) of the collection are shared by all member observations.
        Of the essential properties of an observation, only the value of each actual <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAhasResult">hasResult</a> is not potentially shared by all member
        observations, though at least one of the other properties would be expected to vary between members in a typical
        collection.
    </p>

    <p>For example, <a href="#fig-observation-collection-3"></a> describes a collection of remote sensing observations
        using the same sensor on different scenes, while <a href="#fig-observation-collection-4"></a> is a series of the
        same scene on different days. </p>

    <figure id="fig-observation-collection-3">
        <img alt="Collections of observations 3" src="./images/OC-instance-3.png" style="width:90%" />
        <figcaption>A set of remote sensing observations of different scenes on the same day</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure id="fig-observation-collection-4">
        <img alt="Collections of observations 4" src="./images/OC-instance-4.png" style="width:90%" />
        <figcaption>A series of remote sensing observations of the same scene on the different days</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Collections may be nested.
        For example, an outer observation-collection might share the observed-property, procedure and sensor, and
        contain inner observation-collections at different phenomenon-times, each of which contain a set of observations
        on different features-of-interest (<a href="#fig-observation-collection-1"></a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="fig-observation-collection-1">
        <img alt="Nested collections of observations 1" src="./images/OC-instance-1.png" style="width:90%" />
        <figcaption>Example of a set of nested collections of four observations of the same property of two
            features-of-interest at two different times.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Observations can be factored into collections in more than one way, so more than one set of nested
        observation-collections can collect the same set of atomic results.
        For example, the same outer collection may contain inner collections concerning different features-of-interests,
        each containing a set of observations at different phenomenon-times (<a
            href="#fig-observation-collection-2"></a>).
    </p>

    <figure id="fig-observation-collection-2">
        <img alt="Nested collections of observations 2" src="./images/OC-instance-2.png" style="width:90%" />
        <figcaption>Alternative set of nested collections with the same results of the same property of two
            features-of-interest at two different times.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Effectively, the results of each observation-collection correspond to a <i>slice</i> in a data-cube which is
        composed of the results of the complete set of observations.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        This feature might also apply to collections of <i>Actuations</i> but this application has not yet been
        explored.
    </p>
