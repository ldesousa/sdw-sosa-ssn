<h2>Common Modeling Questions</h2>
This section informally discusses how to handle common modeling questions such as locations, forecasts, and
quantity
values with a unit of measure.

<section id="location">
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
        sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be located via their
        participating entities, e.g., platforms.
        These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains,
        including
        technical disciplines, social and business contexts.
        In these contexts there are a number of implementations that support the expression of spatial properties,
        including location.
        These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]]. </p>
    <p>In particular, GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
        objects, that fosters interoperability between geo-datasets. To do so, these entities can be declared as
        instances of geo:Feature and geometries can be assigned to them via the geo:hasGeometry property.
        In case of classes, e.g., specific features of interests such as rivers, these can be defined as subclasses
        of
        geo:Feature.</p>
    <p>For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it might be described as a
        Sample using the following pattern:</p>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/2023ex1.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

</section>

<section id="forecasts" class="informative">
    <h3>Forecasts</h3>
    <p>One MAY also represent forecasts as observations if the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
        time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
        Given the definition of these terms, it means that: <em>The time when the Observation act was completed is
            before the time that the Result of the observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.</em></p>
    <p class="note"> Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
        For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
        pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.</p>
    <p class="note">Describing a plan for some actuation or observation in the future is not covered by this
        specification.</p>
</section>

<section id="quantity-values-and-unit-of-measures" class="informative">
    <h3>Quantity Values and Unit of Measures</h3>
    <p>The result of an <a href="#SOSAObservation"><code>sosa:Observation</code></a> or an <a
            href="#SOSAActuation"><code>sosa:Actuation</code></a> can be a quantity value with a numeric value and a
        unit
        of measure.

    <p class="note">It is not in the scope of this specification to recommend any particular way of expressing
        results
        as quantity values.
        There exist external vocabularies that are specifically designed for modeling quantity values as OWL
        individuals, or as datatypes.
        Examples include the Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT, [[QUDT]]) the Ontology
        of
        Units of Measure (OM, [[Rijgersberg-et-al-2013]]), and the St Etienne School of Mines <i>Custom
            Datatypes</i>
        (CDT, [[CDT]]). </p>
    <ul>
        <li>With QUDT, a quantitative result would be a <a href="http://qudt.org/"><code>qudt:QuantityValue</code></a>
        </li>
        <li>With OM 2, a quantitative result would be a <a
                href="http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/"><code>om:Measure</code> or <code>om:Point</code></a></li>
        <li>With CDT, the value of <a href="#SOSAhasSimpleResult"><code>sosa:hasSimpleResult</code></a> can be
            structured to match <a
                href="https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/lindt/v4/custom_datatypes#ucum"><code>cdt:ucum</code></a> which
            encodes
            the unit-of-measure using UCUM (UCUM, [[UCUM]])</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Custom datatypes are not strictly compatible with OWL, which restricts the set of datatypes that
        can be used. See sec. 5.2 in [[owl2-syntax]] for more details.</p>

<section id="SOSAProperty-instances" class="informative">
    <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of sosa:Property</h3>
    <p>The previous version of SOSA/SSN left an ambiguity on whether an instance of <a
            href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> should be generic to all features of interest (e.g.,
        <code>ex:Temperature</code>,
        <code>ex:OnOffStatus</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;myBodyTemperature&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;LightStatus&gt;</code>). This version solves the ambiguity
        by
        differentiating:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> for the former case</li>
        <li><a href="#SOSAPropertyOfInterest"><code>sosa:PropertyOfInterest</code></a> for the latter case.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="SOSAComplexSystems" class="informative">
    <h3>Complex devices</h3>
    <p>
        Many sensors and actuators are packaged with other sensors and actuators in a complex device.
        For example, the consumer grade <a href="https://inkbird.com/products/ibs-th2-plus">Inkbird IBS-TH2-PLUS</a>
        has a temperature and relative-humidity sensor in a single package.
        The <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> class provides for this using the <a
            href="#SOSAhasSubSystem"><code>sosa:hasSubSystem</code></a> property.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following diagram shows how an instance and type of the IBS-TH2-PLUS may be modeled using SSN:

<section id="SOSASystem-types-individuals" class="informative">
    <h3>Systems types and individuals</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> is the class of systems,
        i.e. devices or entities that implements procedures to make actuations, observations, or samplings.
        Members of the class are <em>individual</em> systems i.e. system-instances.
        In the physical world these will typically carry a serial-number (devices) or proper-name (people).
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, most individual systems share a primary description with other individuals of the same system
        type, or model number.
        The characteristics and capabilities of the <em>system type</em> will usually provide the key information
        about about
        a system involved in an execution.
        Traditionally this information would appear in a specification or <em>data-sheet</em> for a device type.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SSN Ontology may be used to describe system types as OWL Classes, so that system instances can be typed
        through them.
        The recommended pattern is for
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            a generic system or system type is represented as an OWL Class, specifically as a sub-class of
            <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> or one of its sub-classes
            (<a href="#SOSAActuator"><code>sosa:Actuator</code></a>,
            <a href="#SOSASensor"><code>sosa:Sensor</code></a>,
            <a href="#SOSASampler"><code>sosa:Sampler</code></a>), while
        </li>
        <li>
            an individual system or system instance is represented as an OWL Individual, specifically as an
            instance of the class describing the system type.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following diagram illustrates an example of a sensor type and instance modeled this way.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <a href="images/Thermometer.png"><img alt="Thermometer type and instance example"
                src="images/Thermometer.png"></a>
        <figcaption>Mum's clinical thermometer represented as an instance of a specific sensor type.

        The following code snippet provides an outline of the details:
    </p>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/Thermometer.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <p>
        Note that this approach is a clarification and adjustment relative to earlier editions of this
        Ontology, which suggested that instances of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>
        could represent either generic systems or instances specific to a single execution.
    </p>

    <p>
        More complex systems can be described using class definitions with OWL Restrictions to fix specific
        properties of class members.
        For example, the following code illustrates how a sensor package such as a <a
            href="https://inkbird.com/products/ibs-th2-plus">Inkbird model IBS-TH2-PLUS</a> may be described.
    </p>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/IBS-TH2-PLUS.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>sensor:IBS-TH2-Plus</code> describes the <em>IBS-TH2-PLUS system type</em>.
            Every IBS-TH2-PLUS package records at a frequency in the range 5.556e-4 &mdash; 0.1 Hertz.
            Every IBS-TH2-PLUS has two subsystems, one temperature sensor, and one relative-humidity sensor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>sensor:IBS-TH2-Plus-H</code> describes the <em>humidity sensor type</em> in the IBS-TH2-PLUS
            package.
            Every humidity sensor has a range 0&mdash;99 % RH with an accuracy of 4.5 %.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>sensor:IBS-TH2-Plus-T</code> describes the <em>temperature sensor type</em> in the
            IBS-TH2-PLUS package.
            Every temperature sensor has a range -40&mdash;60 &deg;C with an accuracy of 4.5 %.
        </li>
    </ul>
