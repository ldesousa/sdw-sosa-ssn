<h3>Homogeneous collections and data-cubes</h3>

<p>
  A homogeneous collection of observations shares a common value for one or more of the characteristic observation
  properties.
  For example:
</p>

<p>For example, <a href="#fig-observation-collection-3" class="fig-ref"></a> describes a collection of remote sensing
  observations using the same sensor on different scenes, while <a href="#fig-observation-collection-4"
    class="fig-ref"></a> is a series of the same scene on different days. </p>

<figure id="fig-observation-collection-3">
  <img alt="Collections of observations 3" src="./images/OC-instance-3.png" style="width:90%" />
  <figcaption>A set of remote sensing observations of different scenes on the same day</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure id="fig-observation-collection-4">
  <img alt="Collections of observations 4" src="./images/OC-instance-4.png" style="width:90%" />
  <figcaption>A series of remote sensing observations of the same scene on the different days</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Collections may be nested.
  For example, an outer observation-collection might share the observed-property, procedure and sensor, and contain
  inner observation-collections at different phenomenon-times, each of which contain a set of observations on
  different features-of-interest (<a href="#fig-observation-collection-1" class="fig-ref"></a>).
</p>

<figure id="fig-observation-collection-1">
  <img alt="Nested collections of observations 1" src="./images/OC-instance-1.png" style="width:90%" />
  <figcaption>Example of a set of nested collections of four observations of the same property of two
    features-of-interest at two different times.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Observations can be factored into collections in more than one way, so more than one set of nested
  observation-collections can collect the same set of atomic results.
  For example, the same outer collection may contain inner collections concerning different features-of-interests, each
  containing a set of observations at different phenomenon-times (<a href="#fig-observation-collection-2"
    class="fig-ref"></a>).
</p>

<figure id="fig-observation-collection-2">
  <img alt="Nested collections of observations 2" src="./images/OC-instance-2.png" style="width:90%" />
  <figcaption>Alternative set of nested collections with the same results of the same property of two
    features-of-interest at two different times.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Effectively, the results of each observation-collection correspond to a <i>slice</i> in a data-cube which is
  composed of the results of the complete set of observations.
