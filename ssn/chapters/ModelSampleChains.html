<h3>Sample chains</h3>
<p>
    Many observation workflows rely on a chain of samples, where it is important to understand the provenance of the
    sample which is the (proximate) feature of interest for observations.
    Knowing either the original sample or the initial feature of interest at the base of the chain is useful for both
    discovery and management purposes.</p>
<p>
    For example, gas bubbles from ice-cores are examined in climate research.
    The ice-core is a sample of the ice-sheet, while the bubble taken from the core is a sample of an ancient
    atmosphere.
    The two samples have different values for the <a href="#SOSAisSampleOf">isSampleOf</a> property, reflecting the
    different <a href="#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">hasFeatureOfInterest</a> values for the separate acts of <a
        href="#SOSASampling">Sampling</a>.
    The bubble is also a sample of the atmosphere, which is a feature of interest for the observations.

    <a href="#fig-sample-chain-geology"></a> shows a more complex scenario involving many samples
    derived from an initial one, with some relationships that may be useful in processing and discovery of
    subsequent observations, the intention of which will be to characterize various aspects of the original sample
    which is representative of an ultimate feature of interest.
    This is supported by additional properties for relationships between samples and features of interest at
    specific points in the chain:
    <a href="#SOSAhasOriginalSample">hasOriginalSample</a> and <a href="#SOSAhasSampledFeature">hasSampledFeature</a>.

    <figcaption>It is common to generate a chain of samples in a geology exploration scenario, with initial sample
        retrieval from the field followed by a sequence of sampling steps (pink) to generate a series of
        sub-samples (light green).

<p>
    Having a direct indication of an <em>original sample</em> allows multiple results to be combined to describe the
    sample.
    Having a direct indication of the <em>ultimate feature</em> that was sampled allows discovery of many samples that
    are
    intended to be representative of that feature.

<p class="Note">Note that the scenario in <a href="#fig-sample-chain-geology"></a> is simplified from real-life
    scenarios, and also that the diagram only shows a subset of the full set of resources and relationships.</p>
