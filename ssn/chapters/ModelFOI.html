<h3>Proximate and Ultimate feature of interest</h3>
<p>
    The object of the
    <a href="#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">hasFeatureOfInterest</a> property of an <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a>
    (e.g. Actuation, Observation, or Sampling) is the <i>immediate</i> or <i>proximate</i>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">FeatureOfInterest</a>.
    For example, <a href="#open-window"></a> shows a description of a simple actuation to open a window.

<p>
    In some cases the feature-of-interest of the execution is not the ultimate thing that the act of actuation,
    observation, or sampling is concerned with, but is an intermediate thing.
    This might be a <i>sample</i> of the ultimate feature of interest, or a sample of a sample, etc.
    The relationship between the proximate and ultimate feature of interest might be specified, such as a
    sampling-chain.
    If this relationship is recorded, then an ultimate feature of interest might be inferred.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, it is often the ultimate feature of interest that really matters to the data user, particularly for
    discovery purposes.
    This requirement is met using the <a href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a>
    property</a>.
