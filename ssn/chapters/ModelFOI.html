<h3>Proximate and Ultimate feature of interest</h3>
<p>
    The object of the
    <a href="#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">hasFeatureOfInterest</a> property of an <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a>
    (e.g. Actuation, Observation, or Sampling) is the <i>immediate</i> or <i>proximate</i>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">FeatureOfInterest</a>.
    For example, <a href="#open-window"></a> shows a description of a simple actuation to open a window.

<p>
    In some cases the feature-of-interest of the execution is not the ultimate thing that the act of actuation,
    observation, or sampling is concerned with, but is an intermediate thing.
    This might be a <i>sample</i> of the ultimate feature of interest, or a sample of a sample, etc.
    The relationship between the proximate and ultimate feature of interest might be specified, such as a
    sampling-chain.
    If this relationship is recorded, then an ultimate feature of interest might be inferred.
    Nevertheless, it is often the ultimate feature of interest that really matters to the data user, particularly for
    discovery purposes.
    This requirement is met using the <a href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a>
    property</a>.

    Some patterns for the relationship of the ultimate feature of interest to observations
    (<a href="#fig-observation-ultimate-foi"></a>) and acts of sampling
    (<a href="#fig-sampling-ultimate-foi"></a>), and within sampling-chains, are illustrated below.
