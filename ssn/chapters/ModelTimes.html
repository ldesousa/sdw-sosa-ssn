<h3>Temporal properties</h3>

<p>
    Multiple times are associated with an <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a>. 
    Trivially, since an Execution is a time-bounded activity, there is a <a href="#SOSAstartTime">startTime</a> and <a href="#SOSAendTime">endTime</a>. 
    In the case of <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observation</a> and <a href="#SOSASampling">Sampling</a> the end of the Execution is the time that the result is generated so it is called <a href="#SOSAresultTime">resultTime</a>
    In the case of <a href="#SOSAActuation">Actuation</a> and <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observation</a> the <a href="#SOSAphenomenonTime">phenomenonTime</a> is the interval when the change or result applies to the actuated- or observed-property. 
</p>
<p>
    In the simplest case, an Execution is instantaneous and all these times are the same. 
    More commonly, these times are different. 
    Different kinds of executions have different relationships between these times.
</p>

<h4>Forecast</h4>
<p>
    A forecast may be represented as an observation where the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
    time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
    The time when the Observation execution was completed is before the time that the Result of the
    observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.

<p class="note">
    Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
    For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] adapt the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
    pattern to derive explicit <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.
</p>

<p class="note">
    Describing a plan for some actuation or observation in the future is not covered by this
    specification.
</p>

<h4>Historical observations</h4>
<p>
    Observations in historical sciences, including geology and archeology, may be made to determine the state of the world in the remote past. 
    For example:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the diet of past inhabitants can be determined by examination of middens and other archaeological features
    </li>
    <li>
        the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> can be measured in bubbles in ice-cores that are assumed to sample the atmosphere at some past time
    </li>
    <li>
        the pressure and temperature conditions at which a metamorphic rock was formed can be determined from its mineralogy
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In each of these cases the <a href="#SOSAphenomenonTime">phenomenonTime</a> is far in the past, while the <a href="#SOSAresultTime">resultTime</a> is contemporary.
