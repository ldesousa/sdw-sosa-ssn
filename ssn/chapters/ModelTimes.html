<h3>Temporal properties</h3>

<p>
    Multiple times are associated with an <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a>.
    Trivially, since an Execution is a time-bounded activity, there is a <a href="#SOSAstartTime">startTime</a> and <a
        href="#SOSAendTime">endTime</a>.
    In the case of <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observation</a> and <a href="#SOSASampling">Sampling</a> the end of the
    Execution is the time that the result is generated so it is called <a href="#SOSAresultTime">resultTime</a>.
    In the case of <a href="#SOSAActuation">Actuation</a> and <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observation</a> the <a
        href="#SOSAphenomenonTime">phenomenonTime</a> is the interval when the change or result applies to the actuated-
    or observed-property.
</p>
<p>
    In the simplest case, an Execution is instantaneous and all these times are the same.
    More commonly, these times are different.
    Different kinds of executions have different relationships between these times.
</p>

<h4>Forecast</h4>
<p>
    A forecast may be represented as an observation where the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
    time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
    The time when the Observation execution was completed is before the time that the Result of the
    observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.

<p class="note">
    Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
    For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] adapt the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
    pattern to derive explicit <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.
</p>

<p class="note">
    Describing a plan for some actuation or observation in the future is not covered by this
    specification.
</p>

<h4>Historical observations</h4>
<p>
    Observations in historical sciences, including geology and archeology, may be made to determine the state of the
    world in the remote past.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the diet of past communities can be determined by examination of middens and other archaeological
    features
    (<a href="#diet"></a>)

<p>
    The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> can be measured in bubbles in ice-cores that are assumed to sample the
    atmosphere at some past time.
    In this case, the concentration and age are the results of two initial observations (at the top of <a href="#paleo-atmosphere"></a>).
    These provide input-values to the final observation (at the bottom of <a href="#paleo-atmosphere"></a>).

<p>
    In each of these cases the ultimate <a href="#SOSAphenomenonTime">phenomenonTime</a> is far in the past,
    while the <a href="#SOSAresultTime">resultTime</a> is contemporary.
