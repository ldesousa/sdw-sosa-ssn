<h3>Forecasts</h3>
<p>One MAY also represent forecasts as observations if the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
    time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
    Given the definition of these terms, it means that: <em>The time when the Observation act was completed is
        before the time that the Result of the observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.</em></p>
<p class="note"> Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
    For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
    pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.</p>
<p class="note">Describing a plan for some actuation or observation in the future is not covered by this
    specification.</p>
