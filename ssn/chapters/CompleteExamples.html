<section id="ice-core">
    <h3>Ice Core</h3>
    <p>In order to characterize a thing with a large extent, or which is not directly accessible, the usual
        observational strategy is to obtain one or more samples. Observations can then be made more conveniently on
        the samples, with the intention of characterizing the larger thing. This intentionality is captured using
        the property <code>sosa:isSampleOf</code>. </p>
    <p>In the following example, the ice core is a sample of the Antarctic ice sheet, and observations may be made on
        the ice core and further samples taken from that. </p>
    <p>A convenient side effect of this feature is that all observations related to the larger thing (the ice
        sheet) can be found, and then potentially joined together in a meta-analysis in order to characterize that.

        <p>This example shows how the conditions (temperature and humidity) in a room can be measured using one or
            more sensors.
            Each sensor observes the conditions in its immediate vicinity, and the values are then used to characterize
            the room. </p>
        <p>In Room 145, one of the walls is external in the building, so there is expected to be a temperature gradient
            across the room, and there are two sensors on different walls.
            In Room 245, there is one sensor on the south wall.
            Each of these locations corresponds to a <code>sosa:Sample</code> of the entire room.
            The wall also serves as a <code>sosa:Platform</code> on which the sensors are mounted. </p>

    <h3>InkBird IBS TH2 Sensor</h3>
    <div>
        <p>These examples describe a commercially available platform, the IBS TH2, marketed under the InkBird brand.</p>

        <h4>Recording survival and operating ranges for a sensor</h4>

        <p>
            In this example we represent the capability of the platform temperature sensor to measure ambient air and
            the physical survival limits of its plastic construction.
            Note that this should apply to the platform as well, but in SOSA/SSN, survival ranges only apply to sensors
            and systems, not to platforms.</p>

        <p>xsd:minInclusive and xsd:maxInclusive are used to report the maximum and minimum operating and survival
            ranges for the sensor.
            These are simple properties that are not encoded here as ontological restrictions on observation results.
            Beyond the fact that these ranges apply to the sensor type and not the sensor instance, it is often
            necessary to report out-of-range values, to record the occurrence of an operating condition leading to
            failure.
            It should also be noted that system lifespan can exceed the specification.
            The Voyager 2 spacecraft is a well known example: designed to function for only five years, it is still
            partially operational after 43 years.</p>
