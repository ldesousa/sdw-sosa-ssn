<h2>Common Modeling Questions</h2>
<p>
    The SSN ontology provides a set of general components for describing Actuations, Observations and Samplings.
    However, the supporting classes (i.e. <code>Procedure</code>, <code>ActuationProcedure</code>,
    <code>ObservationProcedure</code>, <code>SamplingProcedure</code>, <code>System</code>, <code>Actuator</code>,
    <code>Sensor</code>, <code>Sampler</code>, <code>FeatureOfInterest</code>, <code>Sample</code>,
    <code>Property</code>, <code>ObservableProperty</code> etc) have no properties specified except for the
    relationships
    between the classes.
    Furthermore, there are a large number of these relation predicates, which can lead to a rather tangled dataset in
    practice.
    Thus, any application that uses SSN must select an implementation pattern to constrain the variability.
    And in order to support interoperability with other applications, the implementation pattern should be formalized
    and shared.
</p>
<p>
    It is beyond the scope of this document to provide implementation profiles.
    However, a number of frequent requirements are discussed and illustrated in this section, including locations,
    forecasts, and quantity values with a unit of measure.
</p>
<p class="note">OGC is planning to develop a register of SSN implementation profiles to support the development of
    interoparable communities using SSN.</p>

<section id="location">
    <h3>Location, sampling location</h3>
    <p>
        Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
        sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be located via their
        participating entities, e.g., platforms.
        These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains, including
        technical disciplines, social and business contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a number of standard implementations that support the expression of spatial properties, including
        location.
        These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]].
        In particular, GeoSPARQL [[geosparql]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
        objects, that fosters interoperability between geo-datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using GeoSPARQL, geometries can be assigned to entities using the geo:hasGeometry property.
        For example, if observations are made of the atmosphere at a specific location, it is recommended that this be
        defined as a Sample whose location is given using GeoSPARQL with the following pattern:</p>

    <h4>Sample with location serialised in Turtle</h4>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2023ex-location.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

    <h4>Sample with location serialised in JSON-LD</h4>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2023ex-location.jsonld" data-include-format="text"></pre>

</section>

<section id="forecasts" class="informative">
    <h3>Forecasts</h3>
    <p>
        A forecast may be represented as an observation where the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> is later in
        time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>.
        This means that: <em>The time when the Observation act was completed is before the time that the Result of the
            observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.</em>
    </p>
    <h4>Forecast serialised in Turtle</h4>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2024ex-forecast.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <h4>Forecast serialised in JSON-LD</h4>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2024ex-forecast.jsonld" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <p class="note">When the datatype is not one of the numeric types, the value is cast as a string literal.</p>
    <p class="note">
        Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but not in the scope of this specification.
        For example [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
        pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code> classes.

<section id="quantity-values-and-unit-of-measures" class="informative">
    <h3>Quantity Values and Unit of Measures</h3>
    <p>
        The result of an <a href="#SOSAObservation"><code>sosa:Observation</code></a> or an <a
            href="#SOSAActuation"><code>sosa:Actuation</code></a> can be a quantity value with a numeric value and a
        unit
        of measure.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        Several external vocabularies are designed for modeling quantity values as OWL individuals, or as datatypes.
        Examples include the Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT, [[QUDT]]) the Ontology of
        Units of Measure (OM, [[Rijgersberg-et-al-2013]]), and the St Etienne School of Mines <i>Custom Datatypes</i>
        (CDT, [[CDT]]). 
    </p>
    <p>
        For a compact representation using <a href="#SOSAhasSimpleResult">sosa:hasSimpleResult</a> it is recommended to use a QUDT Unit as its <i>Datatype</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>Simple Result serialised in Turtle</h4>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2024ex-uomtype.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <h4>Simple Result serialised in JSON-LD</h4>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2024ex-uomtype.jsonld" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <p class="note">When the datatype is not one of the numeric types, the value is cast as a string literal.</p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, a <a href="http://qudt.org/"><code>qudt:QuantityValue</code></a> can represent a quantitative result as an object.   
    </p>
    <h4>Object Result serialised in Turtle</h4>

<section id="SOSAProperty-instances" class="informative">
    <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of sosa:Property</h3>
    <p>The previous version of SOSA/SSN left an ambiguity on whether an instance of <a
            href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> should be generic to all features of interest (e.g.,
        <code>ex:Temperature</code>,
        <code>ex:OnOffStatus</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;myBodyTemperature&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;LightStatus&gt;</code>). This version solves the ambiguity
        by
        differentiating:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> for the former case</li>
        <li><a href="#SOSAPropertyOfInterest"><code>sosa:PropertyOfInterest</code></a> for the latter case.</li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section id="SOSASystem-instances" class="informative">
    <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of sosa:System</h3>
    <p>This specification does not specify whether an instance of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>
        should be generic (e.g., <code>ex:TemperatureSensor</code>,
        <code>ex:LightActuator</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g.,
        <code>&lt;temperatureSensor/84&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;light/112&gt;</code>).
        Implementers are free to choose one way of modeling things or the other.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, one SHOULD NOT use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F12:_Punning">OWL
            punning</a> to make <code>ex:Temperature</code> denote both a subclass of
        <a href="#SOSAProperty"><code>sosa:Property</code></a> and an instance of sosa:Property. In fact, merging the
        two examples below in a
        single RDF Graph would make an OWL reasoner infer that <code>ex:TemperatureSensor</code>,
        <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/1&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;TemperatureSensor/2&gt;</code>, denote the same individual.
    </p>
    <p>This also holds for subclasses of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a>: <a
            href="#SOSASensor"><code>sosa:Sensor</code></a>, <a href="#SOSAActuator"><code>sosa:Actuator</code></a>, and
        <a href="#SOSASampler"><code>sosa:Sampler</code></a>.
    </p>
    <p>This first example is modeling instances of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> as generic:
    </p>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2017ex6.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
    <p>This second example is modeling instances of <a href="#SOSASystem"><code>sosa:System</code></a> as specific:
    </p>
    <pre class="example" data-include="./examples/2017ex7.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
